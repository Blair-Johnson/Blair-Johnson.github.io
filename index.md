**I am a current undergraduate studying Electrical Engineering in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). I conduct machine learning research at the [Information and Communications Laboratory](https://www.gtri.gatech.edu/laboratories/information-and-communications-laboratory) within the [Georgia Tech Research Institute](https://www.gtri.gatech.edu/).**

**Previously, I have worked as a deep learning research and development intern at the Intel Corporation under Dr. Nico Galoppo. I also had the pleasure of working on perception problems for CurbSide.ai, a startup company that sought to improve the safety of dockless electric vehicles.**

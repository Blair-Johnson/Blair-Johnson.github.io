I am a current undergraduate studying Electrical Engineering in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). I conduct machine learning research at the [Information and Communications Laboratory](https://www.gtri.gatech.edu/laboratories/information-and-communications-laboratory) within the [Georgia Tech Research Institute](https://www.gtri.gatech.edu/).

Previously, I have worked as a deep learning research and development intern at the Intel Corporation under Dr. Nico Galoppo. I also had the pleasure of working on perception problems for CurbSide.ai, a startup company that sought to improve the safety of dockless electric vehicles.

## Research Interests
**Robotic Perception:** For robotic agents to solve the general problem of perception, they will need to discover both abstract and physical properties of their environment. Humans form internal representations of perceived objects that encode abstract concept hierarchies on top of physical property estimation. These representations inform how we plan and execute tasks, and I am interested in how future computer vision systems can create equally extensible and efficient representations.

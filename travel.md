## Travel and Outdoors

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>2021</em> - While studying at Georgia Tech Lorraine, I solo-camped on farmland above the English Channel in FÃ©camp, France. There, I captured these images of an incredible hazy sunrize. This area of the coast is littered with lost German bunkers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>2021</em> - This picture was taken during a weekend trip to the Jungfrau region of the Bernese Alps. It's a beautiful and scary place to learn to ski.</p>
